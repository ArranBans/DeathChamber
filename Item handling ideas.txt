Kill player - player manager empty - reorganise code - begin to use more references - destroy and reinstantiate player object - drop items beforehand and reset health.

Item handling system - Contextless model which can be used in conjunction with hands which stay on player. has an itemInfo script which contains relevant information about the instance of the item such as current ammo and attatchments and current firemode and scriptable object. gunInfo will be derrived from this. this can also contain references but not necessary specifically for guns instantiate model then instantiate related scripts - prefab doesn't take more data storing models just reference to model - might be faster and more efficient, however specific things like sniper scopes need to be considered. perhaps some if statement when spawning weapon asking if it is mine or not (perhaps redundant when you consider the use case of spawning a local or otherwise weapon): if weapon is not mine, then find "personal" and delete. perhaps more efficient method to do this than instantiating redundant items. perhaps double instantiation for personal elements? this may prove problematic also considering dependencies. when weapon equipped change the fps arms animation controller to the weapon's one. all animations should work as expected so long as unity links correctly. all moving on the gun should apply to the arms too.
